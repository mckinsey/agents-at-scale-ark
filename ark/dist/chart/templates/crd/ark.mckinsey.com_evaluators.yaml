              EvaluatorSpec defines the configuration for an evaluator that can assess query performance.
              This allows query evaluations to be executed by different evaluation frameworks and systems,
              rather than the built-in evaluation engine.
              Evaluators work as services that process evaluation requests for queries and provide
              performance assessments and scoring.

                            A label selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator that
                            relates the key and values.
                          properties:
                            key:
                              description: key is the label key that the selector
                                applies to.

                                operator represents a key's relationship to a set of values.
                                Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists and DoesNotExist.
                              type: string
                            values:

                                values is an array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn,
                                the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist,
                                the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic
                                merge patch.

                          matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels
                          map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the
                          operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed.
