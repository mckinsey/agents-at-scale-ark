# Event Evaluation Enhanced (Phase 2)

Test enhanced event evaluation with richer metadata and complex expressions for tool calls, A2A interactions, and team executions.

## What it tests
- Enhanced event recording with tool call metadata
- Complex CEL expressions for pattern matching
- A2A (Agent-to-Agent) interaction evaluation
- Team execution flow analysis
- Rich metadata extraction from events

## Running
```bash
chainsaw test
```

Validates that enhanced event evaluation can analyze complex interaction patterns and extract meaningful insights from event streams.
